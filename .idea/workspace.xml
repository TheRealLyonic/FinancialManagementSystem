    <MESSAGE value="Continued losing my mind trying to fix the addMissingEntries() method, but made progress and got the enterNewYear() method working completely as expected." />
    <MESSAGE value="Completed functionality for filling out the rest of the entries in a spreadsheet for a given year, as well as added proper formatting for currency being written to a spreadsheet." />
    <MESSAGE value="The program can now account for any missing dates within a given spreadsheet. Additionally, if the program hasn't been used since the previous year, and there does not exist a spreadsheet with the system's current year as it's name, an error will no longer be thrown. Instead, the findSpreadsheet() method which has been added to the FinancialManagementSystem class will now use a for-loop (Starting at the system's current year and ending at the year 2001) to decrement through previous years until it finds an Excel file with the given year as its name. As of now, regardless of how long it has been since the user has last used the program, everything should run correctly, and then continue as normal after a new spreadsheet has been created for that year, and all missing entries have been accounted for in all spreadsheets in-between." />
    <MESSAGE value="Various small improvements, including setting custom colors for the pie chart, still displays a red and blue, but the red will now consistently be representative of how much you've spent, while blue shows how much you have saved, previously the colors would be assigned randomly." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed bug in the pie chart class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed a bug in the FinancialManagementSystem class where if the last date of a spreadsheet was the last day of that year (I.e. 12/31/2022), the program would enter all of the information for the following year (I.e. 2023) in that spreadsheet, and continue endlessly. It now functions as expected and will simply create a new spreadsheet for the following year in such an event. Also continued work on the U.I. in both the UserInterface and Deposit class, as well as adjusted the Fonts interface to include different size options for the Roboto font." />
    <MESSAGE value="Turns out there was still a problem with the Pie chart displaying colors correctly, fixed all bugs in that department, and now it will always color the spent percentage red, and the saved percentage blue." />
    <MESSAGE value="Improved rendering of the balance text by making its size and position dynamic, based on how large it's quantity is, so the text always appears mostly centered. Also began work on the Expenditure class, and made an icon for the new window. It's JFrame appearance will be more or less the same as the Deposit class, with minor differences where necessary." />
    <MESSAGE value="Continued work on the Deposit class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added purchase summary JTextArea in the Expenditure class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added functionality for the confirm button in both the Deposit and Expenditure class. Balance will now automatically refresh upon submitting a new deposit or expenditure, the pie-chart, however, will not. Lots of problems trying to get that to work, removed all efforts for now, will have to return to this problem later. Everything else looking great, will probably aim to get purchase summaries working next." />
    <MESSAGE value="The primary UserInterface now refreshes when a new expenditure is added, so both the balance text and pie-chart is updated without needing additional methods for each of them. Also implemented the correct functionality for adding purchase descriptions, and made the program display a basic error message within the Expenditure JFrame if the user tries to submit a new expenditure with the default text in the TextArea. The Error message is displayed in a new color added to the Colors interface, ERROR_RED." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added some more error checks to both the Deposit and Expenditure class, so that now, no matter what input the user tries to give within the text boxes, if it is not usable by the program, it will be rejected with a clear explanation as to why.
